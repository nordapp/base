The system is built using the following rules

§1 Each object has it's own UUID that is always unique and not null

§2 Each object has a history that is a UUID but must not be unique but must be not null

§3 Each history is a common object with a UUID

§4 To build a history, clone the object and put the UUID as value to the history field. Then set a new UUID.
