/**
 * Basic information interface
 * 
 * This interface is used to get every data object by it's UUID and history.
 * 
 * Every OfficeBase object must have a random generated UUID for identification
 * and a random generated history. To create a history, clone the object using
 * the CreateObjectService or as similar mechanism before changing the object's
 * attributes. After then, update the history by a new random generated UUID
 * and leaf the UUID of the clone unchanged.
 * 
 * It is a good practice to store the history objects in a separate data store.
 * 
 * We use REDIS to get the information where the object's data is stored.
